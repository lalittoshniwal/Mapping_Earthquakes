# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this analysis was to use the knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data to create an interactive map. There are following features to the map:

1. Â I added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

2. I added major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), added color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and added a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

3. Using the options from the Mapbox styles, added three map styles (street, satellite, and dark) as a tile layer object.
